# VPN Practice Lab

This repository demonstrates a hands-on practice lab for understanding **OpenVPN client and server workflows**.  
It is designed for learning purposes and does not connect to a real server.

## Overview

- Created a sample `.ovpn` file for OpenVPN client import.
- Learned how VPN clients connect to servers using configuration files.
- Demonstrated understanding of certificates, keys, and connection parameters.
- Showcased VPN client GUI usage on Windows.

## File Details

- `demo-project.ovpn`: Sample OpenVPN client configuration file (for learning purposes only).
- `screenshots/`: Screenshots showing OpenVPN GUI importing the config and the config file opened in Notepad.

## How to Use

1. Download OpenVPN Community Edition: [https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/](https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/)
2. Place `demo-project.ovpn` in an accessible folder.
3. Open OpenVPN GUI → Right-click tray icon → Import file → Select `demo-project.ovpn`.
